This program implements Smart Graphics in a Crestron SIMPL Sharp Pro program.
Currently the following Smart Graphics items are included:

- Standard List
- Dynamic List
- Dynamic Icon List
- Keypad
- DPad

Implemented functions are:
 - Feedback
 - Enable/Disable
 - Visibility 
 - Dynamic Text 
 - Dynamic Icons (both Analog and Serial)
 
Helper classes are included as well.

More feartures may be added with consideration that each feature and abstraction makes it more difficult for a new developer to follow.  
 
Forks and pull requests are welcome.

Todo: 
- Add unit tests.
- read from config files.
